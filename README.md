## **What is a Database?**

A **database** is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Think of it like a digital filing cabinet where all your data is stored in a structured way so that you can find and use it efficiently.



## **Key Concepts:**
1. **Data**: Any kind of information – names, numbers, images, etc.
2. **Tables:** Most databases store data in tables, which are like spreadsheets with rows and columns.
3. **Records:** Each row in a table is called a record – it represents a single item.
4. **Fields:** Each column is a field, representing a category of information.



## **Types of Databases:**
1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS):**
   - Store data in tables with relationships between them.
   - Use **SQL (Structured Query Language).**
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.

2. **NoSQL Databases:**
   - Designed for more flexible data storage (not just tables).
   - Good for large-scale or unstructured data.
   - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Firebase, CouchDB.

3. **In-memory Databases:**
   - Data is stored in memory for faster access.
   - Examples: Redis, Memcached.

4. **Cloud Databases:**
   - Hosted on cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
   - Scalable and accessible online.
